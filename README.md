## TRASH MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
    This contains the Project based on Leach Protocol.
    In this we'll simulate the connection of Trash Bins to map route to each.
    
### Leach Protocol
    This uses cluster based on thier group and a cluster head based on thier capacity.
    Here the Capacity of all bins will remain same, therefore random cluster head will be selected from the cluster.
